This problem was asked by Facebook.

Given a list of integers, return the largest product that can be made by multiplying any three integers.

For example, if the list is [-10, -10, 5, 2], we should return 500, since that's -10 * -10 * 5.

You can assume the list has at least three integers.

$(document).ready(function() {

  $('#form1').submit(function(){
    event.preventDefault()
    input1 = $('#input-1').val()
    input1 = input1.replace(/\'/g,'"')
    input2 = JSON.parse(input1)
    console.log(input1)
    $('#output-1').text(spiral(input2))
  })
